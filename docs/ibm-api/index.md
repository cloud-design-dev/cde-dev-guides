# Configuring Environment

## placeholder

The examples in this IAM section use the IBM Cloud Code Engine Python SDK which can be installed using the command:

```shell
pip install --upgrade ""
```

You will also need to export the following environment variables if they are not already set:

```shell
export IBMCLOUD_API_KEY='YOUR IBM CLOUD API KEY'
export RESOURCE_GROUP='NAME OF RESOURCE_GROUP TO USE FOR DEPLOYMENTS"
```

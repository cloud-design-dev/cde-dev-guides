# Configure Environment

To start using the IBM Cloud [CLI][cli] you can install the tool [locally](#local-prerequisites) or use [Cloud Shell](#cloud-shell).

### Local Prerequisites

- [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-install-ibmcloud-cli) installed.

    ```shell
    curl -sL http://ibm.biz/idt-installer | bash
    ```

- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) installed.

### Cloud Shell

IBM Cloud Shell is a free service that gives you complete control of your cloud resources, applications, and infrastructure, from any web browser. It’s instantly accessible from your free IBM Cloud account—no other installation is needed.

In the IBM Cloud console, click the IBM Cloud Shell icon ![IBM Cloud Shell icon](terminal-cloud-shell.svg). A session starts and automatically logs you in through the IBM Cloud CLI. The direct link to open a new session is
